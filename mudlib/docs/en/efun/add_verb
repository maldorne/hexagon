add_verb

void add_verb(string str)

This function is connected to the add_action() function. It will set up
the command str to trigger a call to the function set up by the previous 
call to add_action().

This function is now obsolete as the verb can be given directly with
add_action(). add_verb() remains for compatibility.

See also: add_action, query_verb.
