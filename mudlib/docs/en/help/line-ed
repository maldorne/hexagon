When in 'ed', the prompt is ':'.

Ed has two modes, command mode and insert mode. The insert mode has
no prompt. You exit the insert mode by typing a single '.' on a line.

All commands have the following syntax:

X,Ycmd

or
Xcmd

For example:

1,10p
Will print line 1 to 10.
1,5d
Will delete line 1 to 5.
8p
Will print line 8.
A '.' is the "current line". The current line is the last line
referenced. If you want to print last line + 10 more:
.,.+10p

Commands that use a line range:
If no line is given, then curent line is printed.

p Print line.
d Delete line.
l Print line with control characters.
r file  Read in a file after the line specified.
s Substitute patterns. See special documentation.
z Print 10 lines.
a Start insert mode after specified line. Exit with '.'<return>.
i Start insert mode before specified line. Exit with '.'<return>.

Commands used without line specification:

q Quit. Won't work if file is changed.
Q Quit and discard all changes if not saved.
w Write the file out.
w file  Write the file out with name 'file'.
e file  Edit a file.

As line numbers '.' is current line, and '$' is last line of file.
Thus '1,$p' will always print all of the file.

Substitutions are very advanced.

First a simple example:

s/apa/bepa/
This will substitue the 'apa' in current line to 'bepa'.
If an 'p' is appended, you will also immediately see the result.

1,$s/apa/bepa/
Same, but all lines in file. Only first occurence on every line.

Any character can used instead of '/':
s!apa!bepa!g
The 'g' specifies that all occurences of apa on this line are changed to bepa.

The pattern that are supposed to be replaced, can be a regular expression.
See ed3 about that.

Searching is done with:
/hello/
Find first line in of after current line.
Just // will repeat the search.

Theere are special characters that can be used in the pattern:
. Match any character.
x*  Match any numbers of x (0 or more).
[abc] Match 'a', 'b' or 'c'.
[0-9] Match any digit 0 - 9.
[a-z] Match any lowercase letter.
\x  Match 'x' where 'x' can be any character except '(' and ')'.

Example:
s/ab.d/ABCD/
Substitute any string 'abXd' against 'ABCD' where X can be any character.

How to copy from a standard file.

Enter ed. Then do 'r /room/vill_green.c'. Now you have something in the
buffer. Change it into what you want it to be. Then 'w /save/players/peter/hall.c'.
Or 'w hall.c'.
