Help for the line editor:

I - Insert lines: This command asks for a line number
    and will insert the new text before it.
D - Delete line: Introduce a range of lines to delete.
L - Show the lines written.
M - Modify the text. Introduce a range of lines and the text to
    substitute within those lines.
C - Continue editing. It's basically the same as inserting at
    the end of the text.
E - Use the 'ed' editor. Use with caution.
S - Exit the editor and save the text.
Q - Exit the editor without saving the text (what you wrote will be lost).
H - Show this help file.

The line ranges are specified as 'number..number',
    examples: 1..2, or 3..4
