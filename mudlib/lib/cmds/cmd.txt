AuroraMUD command handler.			9 Mar 1995 Chrisy
========================== 

Creating a command for this handler is very simple. In the header
file aurora/cmd.h  (This may just be cmd.h on some installations)
the definitions needed are declared. You need to inherit CMD_BASE
for a command.


A skeleton command might be: (Note, this is for Aurora. Mudlib
differences will be discussed below).

File: /global/creator/cmds/write.c

#include <aurora/cmd.h>

inherit CMD_BASE;

void setup()
{
	position = CREATOR;
}

string query_usage()
{
	return "write [-notabs] [-lower|-upper] string";
}

string query_short_help()
{
	return "Writes the specified string on the screen.\n"+
		"	-notabs	Reduce tabs to a single space.\n"+
		"	-lower	Lowercase the entire string.\n"+
		"	-upper	Uppercase the entire string.";
}

int cmd(string tail)
{
	string *params;
	int i, notabs, upper, lower;

	notabs = upper = lower = 0;

	params = explode(tail, " ");

	for(i=0; i<sizeof(params) && params[i][0]=='-'; i++);
	tail = implode(params[i..sizeof(params)-1], " ");
	params = params[0..i-1];

	if(member_array("-notabs", params) != -1)
		notabs++;

	if(member_array("-upper", params) != -1)
		upper++;

	if(member_array("-lower", params) != -1)
		lower++;

	if(upper && lower)
	{
		write("You should specify only one of -upper or -lower!\n"+
			"Usage: "+query_usage()+"\n\n");
		return 1;
	}

	if(notabs)
		tail = replace(tail, "\t", " ");

	if(upper)
		tail = upper_case(tail);

	if(lower)
		tail = lower_case(tail);

	write(tail+"\n");
	return 1;
}


This does as you might expect it to.

Each command object has three variables (at present) that is can modify
to define it's behaviour. These are "position", "doclone" and "dodest".

position:
	This set's the level of the person required to allow them
	to use this command. Level means "player", "creator",
	"lord" and so forth. The actual values you should assign
	are mudlib dependant. Refer to local documentation (see below).

doclone:
	This tells the handler whether it should actually clone a
	copy of the command object, or use the master copy.
	You would use this if the object used some form of call back,
	like input_to or more_file. Default is 0, no cloneing. Set it
	to 1 to clone.
	NOTE: You should set doclone to 0 inside of cmd() before it
	returns if need be, otherwise the command handler will go
	and dest the object upon it's return.

dodest:
	This says whether the object should be dested after use. Not
	really useful, but there anyway. Default is 0, not to.

command_giver:
	This is an object and points to the current "command giver",
	ie, the person who issued the command. This is more reliable
	than this_player() (or the macro TP).

The return value from cmd is as for normal add_actioned commands.
If it returns 0, then it is deemed to have failed or not be
recognised. You should set notify_fail("xx"); to a string should
you wish some sort of fail message be given to the user. The
command handler returns control straight to the mud (it does not
continue searching) and the mud then carries on it's normal command
search. If you return 1, then control it sent back to the player.


Command aliasing.
=================

You can create command "aliases" by adding entries to the file
(creating it if necessary) _CMD_ALIASES in the same directory as
the command. These lines are of the form:

	alias command verb1 verb2 ...

You only *need* one verb. "command" is the name of the _actual_
command. The verbs are the aliases for it.  These alias files are
only read when the handler updates it hash mapping (see the rehash
command below).

Command handler commands.
=========================

The command handler defines a number of commands itself. These are
briefly described below:

cmd command
	This gives some general information on the command specified,
	such as where it resides and how many times it has been accessed.

rehash [-v]
	This tells the command handler to update it's internal
	command hash, and reload the aliases. The -v option enables
	verbose mode and it tells the user what it is doing.

cmdhelp command
	This gives any help the command has to offer on itself. The
	results depend entirely on what the command returns.

Mudlib differences.
===================

AuroraMUD
---------

The positions are declared in /secure/master.h. Not everyone can
read this file, but the definitions are CREATOR, LORD and HIGH_LORD.
To set to player access, set the position variable to 0 (or leave
it alone since it's the default).

The include line is
	#include <aurora/cmd.h>

Realms of the Dragon
--------------------

The positions are declared in /secure/master.h. Not everyone can
read this file, but the definitions are CODER_CMD, LORD_CMD and
HIGH_LORD_CMD. To set to player access, set the position variable
to 0 (or leave it alone since it's the default).

The include line is
	#include <cmd.h>
