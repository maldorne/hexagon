/** Function added to room.c by Bivins on FR-MUD 1/28/93 2am **/
shield_it(string str, string waitpunk)

This function in room.c can ban anyone except gods from entering/ porting
into a room.  I hope to make it to where the shield is just from teleporting,
but right now it is shield from entering the room period. It should be put it
the room's init function.
 The str variable can be filled by the following:
  "players"  - keeps players out.
  "creators" - keeps creators (patrons) and players out.
  "demigods" - keeps demigods out..(Only a god has the right
                                                      to use the demigod setting.)
The waitpunk variable can be filled by:
  any room filename, ie "/d/fr/daggerford/ladyluck"
- This setting is where it will send the person that fails to pass
   through the shield.

example:

void init() {
shield_it("players","/d/fr/daggerford/ladyluck");
::init();
}
/* This will bounce any player that trys to port/walk into the room to
ladyluck, instead of the desired room. It will allow anyone above a
player into the room, and give them a success message. */
