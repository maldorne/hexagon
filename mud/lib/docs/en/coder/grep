Usage : grep <string> <files>

Grep stands for Get Regular ExPression (I think) and if it doesn't, the unix
version will take a regular expression and search files for it.  The version on
the mud just takes a string and tries to find all occurances of it through the
files specified.

Examples:

grep frog /std/living/*.c
grep this_player() test.c
grep am /log/APPLICATIONS
Usage: grep <pattern> <files>

Grep is used to search through the list of files given for any occurance of 
the pattern.  Useful if you are trying to find every file which has the
word frog in it for instance.  The optional flag -n means that it doesnt
print the line that the string occured on, it just prints the file name.

Examples:

grep frog /global/*

grep -n frog *
