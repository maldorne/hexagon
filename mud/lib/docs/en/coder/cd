Usage : cd [directory]

cd is used to change your current directory.  If the directory to change to
is not specified, you will change into your homedir that is specified with the
homedir command.  Directories can be specified relative to your current
or absolutely from the root dir.  The two special directories exist '.' and '..'
which have the meanings current dir, and next dir up, respectively. for more
information on this have a look at /doc/general/filesystem.
